    "# Non-parametric Estimators: Confidence intervals without normality\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing confidence intervals without relying on the normality of the underlying data is a crucial aspect of non-parametric statistics. Here’s a breakdown of how this can be done, particularly using the example of an exponential distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Confidence Intervals for Exponential Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential Distribution Basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential distribution is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process.\n",
    "It has a probability density function (PDF) given by $$( f(x; \\lambda) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} )$$ for $( x \\geq 0 )$, where $( \\lambda )$ is the rate parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean of Exponential Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean $( \\mu )$ of an exponential distribution is $( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Gamma Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of $( n )$ independent exponential random variables with rate $( \\lambda )$ follows a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $( n )$ and rate parameter $( \\lambda )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $( X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n )$ are i.i.d. exponential random variables with rate $( \\lambda )$, then $( \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\sim \\text{Gamma}(n, \\lambda) )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing the Confidence Interval (using Chi-Squared):\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a confidence interval for the mean $( \\mu )$, we can use the fact that $( 2\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i )$ follows a chi-squared distribution with $( 2n )$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "Let $( S = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i )$. Then $( 2\\lambda S \\sim \\chi^2_{2n} )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the chi-squared distribution, we can find the critical values $( \\chi^2_{2n, \\alpha/2} )$ and $( \\chi^2_{2n, 1-\\alpha/2} )$ for a given confidence level $( 1-\\alpha )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence Interval Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "The $( 100(1-\\alpha)% )$ confidence interval for $( \\mu )$ is given by: $[ \\left( \\frac{2S}{\\chi^2_{2n, 1-\\alpha/2}}, \\frac{2S}{\\chi^2_{2n, \\alpha/2}} \\right) ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $( S )$ is the sample sum of the exponential random variables, and $( \\chi^2_{2n, \\alpha/2} )$ and $( \\chi^2_{2n, 1-\\alpha/2} )$ are the chi-squared critical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the properties of the gamma and chi-squared distributions, we can construct confidence intervals for the mean of an exponential distribution without assuming normality. This approach is particularly useful in non-parametric statistics where the underlying distribution may not be normal."

    "**Find Critical Values:**\n",
