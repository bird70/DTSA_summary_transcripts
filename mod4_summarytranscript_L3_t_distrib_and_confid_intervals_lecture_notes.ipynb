    "# Mod4/L3: Statistical Inference: T-Distribution and Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Large Sample Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a random sample of size n (IID) from any distribution with:\n",
    "- Mean μ \n",
    "- Finite variance σ²\n",
    "- Sample size n > 30-40 generally considered \"large\"\n",
    "- Larger samples recommended for critical applications\n",
    "- Visual inspection of histograms advised for asymptotic normality assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "### Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "- For large n, X̄ is asymptotically/approximately normal\n",
    "- Properties:\n",
    "  - Mean = μ (original distribution mean)\n",
    "  - Variance = σ²/n (original variance/n))\n",
    "  - Standardized form: (X̄ - μ)/(σ/√n) → N(0,1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sample Variance and Large Sample CI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Variance Properties\n",
    "- s² is unbiased estimator of σ²\n",
    "- s² converges to σ² in probability\n",
    "- Can substitute s for σ in large samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Sample CI Formula\n",
    "(1-α)100% CI:\n",
    "```\n",
    " X̄ ± z_(α/2) * (s/√n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Small Sample Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Must know underlying distribution (typically normal)\n",
    "- Both μ and σ² unknown\n",
    "- Sample size too small for CLT\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Distribution Method\n",
    "- Use t-distribution with (n-1) degrees of freedom\n",
    "- CI Formula: \n",
    "```\n",
    "X̄ ± t_(α/2,n-1) * (s/√n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glucose Monitoring System Study\n",
    "- Sample size: n = 20\n",
    "- Sample mean: X̄ = 187 days\n",
    "- Sample variance: s² = 16.2 days\n",
    "- Confidence level: 95% (α = 0.05)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "- Critical value: t_(0.975,19) = 2.09\n",
    "- 95% CI: [185.11, 188.88] days\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Large samples (n > 30) use z-distribution\n",
    "2. Small samples require t-distribution\n",
    "3. Normal distribution assumption critical for small samples\n",
    "4. CI interpretation: range of plausible parameter values\n",
    "\n",

    "- Two-sample comparisons\n",
    "- Population mean differences\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing connections"
