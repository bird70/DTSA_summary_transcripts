    "# Mod4/L3: Statistical Inference: T-Distribution and Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Large Sample Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a random sample of size $(n)$ $(IID)$ from any distribution with:\n",
    "- Mean $μ$ \n",
    "- Finite variance $σ²$\n",
    "- Sample size $n$ > 30-40 generally considered \"large\"\n",
    "- Larger samples recommended for critical applications\n",
    "- Visual inspection of histograms advised for asymptotic normality assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "### Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "- For large $n$, $\\bar X$ is asymptotically/approximately normal\n",
    "- Properties:\n",
    "  - Mean = $\\mu$ (original distribution mean)\n",
    "  - Variance = $σ²/n$ (original variance/n))\n",
    "  - Standardized form: $$\\frac{(\\bar X - \\mu)}{\\frac{\\sigma }{\\sqrt(n)}} → N(0,1)$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sample Variance and Large Sample Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Variance Properties\n",
    "- $s²$ is unbiased estimator of $σ²$\n",
    "- $s²$ converges to $σ²$ in probability\n",
    "- Can substitute $s$ for $σ$ in large samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Sample CI Formula\n",
    "$(1- \\alpha)$ 100% CI:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar X \\pm \\bar z (\\frac{\\alpha}{2}) * (\\frac {s}{\\sqrt(n)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Small Sample Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Must know underlying distribution (typically normal)\n",
    "- Both $μ$ and $σ²$ unknown\n",
    "- Sample size too small for CLT\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Distribution Method\n",
    "- Use t-distribution with $(n-1)$ degrees of freedom\n",
    "- CI Formula: \n",
    "$$ \\bar X \\pm \\bar t (\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, n - 1 ) * (\\frac {s}{\\sqrt(n)})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glucose Monitoring System Study\n",
    "- Sample size: $n$ = 20\n",
    "- Sample mean: $X̄$ = 187 days\n",
    "- Sample variance: $s²$ = 16.2 days\n",
    "- Confidence level: 95% $(α = 0.05)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "- Critical value: $\\bar t (0.975,19)$ = 2.09\n",
    "- 95% CI: [185.11, 188.88] days\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Large samples $(n > 30)$ use z-distribution\n",
    "2. Small samples require t-distribution\n",
    "3. Normal distribution assumption critical for small samples\n",
    "4. CI interpretation: range of plausible parameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Topics\n",
    "- Two-sample comparisons\n",
    "- Population mean differences\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing connections"
