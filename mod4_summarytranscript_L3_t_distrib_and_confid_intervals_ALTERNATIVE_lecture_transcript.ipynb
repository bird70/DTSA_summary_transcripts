    "\n",
    "Consider a random sample of size n (IID) from any distribution with:\n",
    "- Mean μ \n",
    "- Finite variance σ²\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large Sample Properties\n",
    "- Sample size typically n > 30 or 40\n",
    "- For critical applications, larger samples recommended\n",
    "- Visual inspection of histograms advised for asymptotic normality assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Central Limit Theorem Application\n",
    "\n",
    "For large samples:\n",
    "- X̄ is asymptotically normal\n",
    "- Mean = μ (original distribution mean)\n",
    "- Variance = σ²/n (original variance/n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Point on Asymptotic Normality\n",
    "The standardized quantity (X̄ - μ)/(σ/√n) converges in distribution to N(0,1)\n",

    "## Using Sample Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "When σ² is unknown:\n",
    "- Sample variance s² is an unbiased estimator of σ²\n",
    "- s² converges in probability to σ²\n",
    "- For large samples, can substitute s for σ\n",

    "\n",
    "The approximate (1-α)100% confidence interval for μ is:\n",

    "## (2) Small Sample Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements for Small Samples\n",
    "- Must know underlying distribution\n",
    "- Normal distribution case most common\n",
    "- Both μ and σ² unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Distribution Application\n",
    "\n",
    "For normal samples with unknown σ²:\n",
    "- Use t-distribution with (n-1) degrees of freedom\n",
    "- Critical values from t-distribution tables/software\n",
    "- Confidence interval: \n",
    "```\n",
    "X̄ ± t_(α/2,n-1) * (s/√n)\n",

    "## (3) Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Glucose monitoring system sensor study:\n",
    "- n = 20 patients\n",
    "- X̄ = 187 days (average lifetime)\n",
    "- s² = 16.2 days (sample variance)\n",
    "- α = 0.05 (95% confidence level)\n",
